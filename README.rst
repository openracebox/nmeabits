nmeabits
========

nmeabits is a collection of useful tools when working with NMEA0183 data.

It has tools to do things like:

* replay a NMEA0183 file over TCP repeatedly.
* show NMEA0183 bus health.

For developers the usual set of checksum and some message decoding is
available.

nmeabits is free software meant to run on your own computer. No registration
necessary.
